    <h1>Propaganda!</h1>
    <h2 style="color: #eeaa66">About</h2>
    <p>
        Propaganda! is a game inspired by the way the blaseball community made a lot of memes to convince others to vote one way or another in elections.

        <h2>How do i play?</h2>
        Join the community on discord! The game is all about making art and less about voting, you can of couse choose just to vote, however its more fun to create propaganda!<br>
        Once you have something you want to convince people to vote for, you can create memes and art to try and sway peoples opinion. <br>
        You can then post that creation in the billboard channel in the discord!
        Each election takes a week to go through, the first 5 days you can see what you will be able to vote for, then the next 24 hours you may cast your single vote. Finally for 24 hours after the election, you can see the results and the items will be distributed!

        It is made by a single fox, <a href="https://beefox.xyz">Bee</a>, a former member of the blaseball community who has made many projects related to it.
        <br>
        It will run until star is no longer having fun, so play fairly and respect each other, there is no promise of how long it will last, just like blaseball, it will be only a flash in the pan of your life.
